# Chapter 11: How to Solve Real Business Problems?

## Problem Introduction

You've mastered various N8N features and techniques, and can create complex workflows and automation systems. However, when facing real business needs, how do you start from requirements analysis and completely solve a real problem? How do you transform theoretical knowledge into practical solutions?

"How do I analyze business requirements? How do I design solutions? How do I implement and test? How do I deploy and monitor? How do I train and document?" These real-world problem-solving processes may confuse you. But don't worry, this chapter will teach you how to completely solve real problems through 5 real business scenarios.

This chapter is divided into 5 scenario lesson plans, each being a complete project:
1. **Scenario 1: Customer Support Automation** - Automatically process customer support tickets
2. **Scenario 2: Content Marketing Automation** - Automatically collect, generate, and publish content
3. **Scenario 3: Data Report Automation** - Automatically collect data and generate reports
4. **Scenario 4: Inventory Management Automation** - Intelligent inventory management system
5. **Scenario 5: Employee Onboarding Automation** - Complete employee onboarding process

Each scenario lesson plan contains a complete project process, from requirements analysis to project summary, helping you master the complete ability to solve real problems.
