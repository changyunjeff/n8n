# Chapter 3: How to Create My First Workflow?

## Problem Introduction

You've successfully installed and configured N8N and familiarized yourself with the user interface. Now, you're probably eager to create your first automated workflow and make N8N work for you. However, facing a blank canvas, you might have many questions: Where should I start? How do I add nodes? How do I connect them? How do I make the workflow actually run?

These questions are normal. Creating your first workflow is like learning to ride a bicycle—it might seem difficult at first, but once you master the basic methods, you'll find it's actually simple and very interesting. This chapter will teach you step-by-step how to create your first workflow from scratch. We'll start with a simple "Hello World" workflow and gradually learn how to add nodes, configure parameters, connect nodes, and how to test and execute workflows.

Through this chapter, you'll be able to create complete workflows with multiple nodes, understand how data flows between nodes, and be able to read and debug execution logs. This will lay a solid foundation for your subsequent learning of more complex workflows.

## Core Concepts

### Basic Structure of Workflows

Understanding the basic structure of workflows is the foundation for creating any workflow. A complete workflow typically consists of three main parts:

#### 1. Trigger

A trigger is the starting point of a workflow, determining when the workflow starts. Trigger nodes are usually located on the leftmost side of the workflow.

**Common Trigger Types**:
- **Schedule Trigger**: Scheduled trigger that executes on a time schedule (e.g., every day at 9 AM, every Monday)
- **Webhook Trigger**: Webhook trigger that receives external HTTP requests
- **Email Trigger**: Email trigger that triggers when a new email is received
- **Manual Trigger**: Manual trigger that executes when manually clicked

**Functions of Triggers**:
- Start the workflow
- Provide initial data
- Determine when the workflow executes

#### 2. Processing Nodes

Processing nodes are the core of workflows, performing actual work: fetching data, transforming data, executing operations, etc.

**Common Processing Node Types**:
- **HTTP Request**: Send HTTP requests, call APIs
- **Set**: Set or modify data fields
- **Code**: Execute JavaScript code
- **IF**: Conditional judgment, branch based on conditions
- **Function**: Execute custom functions

**Characteristics of Processing Nodes**:
- Receive data from upstream nodes
- Process the data
- Pass processed data to downstream nodes

#### 3. Output Nodes

Output nodes are the endpoints of workflows, outputting results to external systems or saving data.

**Common Output Node Types**:
- **Email**: Send emails
- **Slack**: Send Slack messages
- **Google Sheets**: Write to Google Sheets
- **Webhook Response**: Return HTTP response
- **Save to File**: Save to file

**Workflow Structure Diagram**:
```
[Trigger] → [Processing Node 1] → [Processing Node 2] → ... → [Output Node]
```

### Adding and Connecting Nodes

#### Adding Nodes

In N8N, adding nodes is very simple:

1. **Click the "+" button on the canvas** or **double-click blank area on canvas**
2. **Search for node**: Enter node name in search box (e.g., "Schedule", "HTTP Request")
3. **Select node**: Choose the needed node from search results
4. **Node appears on canvas**: Node is automatically added to canvas

[Screenshot location: Interface for adding nodes]

#### Connecting Nodes

Connections between nodes define data flow:

1. **Drag from source node**: Place mouse on right connection point of source node
2. **Drag to target node**: Drag connection line to left connection point of target node
3. **Connection complete**: Connection line appears between two nodes

**Connection Rules**:
- Data can only flow from upstream nodes to downstream nodes
- A node can have multiple output connections (data branching)
- A node can have multiple input connections (data merging)

[Screenshot location: Diagram of node connections]

#### Configuring Nodes

Each node needs configuration to work properly:

1. **Click node**: Select node to configure
2. **Open configuration panel**: Right panel shows node configuration panel
3. **Fill parameters**: Fill corresponding parameters based on node type
4. **Save configuration**: Configuration is automatically saved

**Configuration Examples**:
- **Schedule Trigger**: Set execution time (e.g., "Every day at 9 AM")
- **HTTP Request**: Set URL, method, headers, etc.
- **Set**: Set fields to add or modify

### Workflow Execution and Testing

#### Testing Workflows

Before formally executing a workflow, it's recommended to test first:

1. **Click "Test workflow" button**: In workflow toolbar
2. **Select test node**: Can choose to test entire workflow or single node
3. **View test results**: Test results displayed below node
4. **Check data**: Click node to view input and output data

**Benefits of Testing**:
- Quickly verify if node configuration is correct
- View input and output data of each node
- Discover configuration errors, avoid execution failures

#### Executing Workflows

After testing passes, can formally execute workflow:

1. **Activate workflow**: Click switch in top right corner of workflow to activate
2. **Manual execution**: Click "Execute Workflow" button to manually execute
3. **Automatic execution**: If using trigger (e.g., Schedule), workflow will automatically execute
4. **View execution results**: View execution history in "Executions"

#### Execution Logs

Execution logs record the execution process of workflows:

- **Execution status**: Success (green), failure (red), running (yellow)
- **Execution time**: Start time, end time, duration
- **Node status**: Execution status and data of each node
- **Error information**: If failed, shows detailed error information

       - **Value**: `{{ $now }}` (current time)

3. **Save configuration**

**Expression Notes**:
- `{{ $json }}`: Get JSON data from upstream node
- `{{ $now }}`: Get current time
- `{{ $json.fieldName }}`: Get specific field from JSON

[Screenshot location: Set node configuration panel]

#### 3.3 Test Set Node

1. **Click "Test workflow" button**
2. **View Set node output**: Confirm data is correctly set

### Step 4: Add Output Node

Now let's add an output node to display results.

#### 4.1 Choose Output Method

Based on your needs, can choose different output methods:

**Method A: Use Webhook Response (Recommended for testing)**
- Simple, no additional configuration needed
- Suitable for testing and demonstration

**Method B: Use Email Node**

3. **Select "Webhook Response" node**
4. **Configure node**:
   - **Response Code**: 200
   - **Response Body**: `{{ $json }}` (return processed data)

[Screenshot location: Webhook Response node]

**Note**: Webhook Response needs to be used with Webhook Trigger. For Schedule Trigger, we can use other output methods.

#### 4.3 Add Code Node as Output (Alternative)

Since Schedule Trigger cannot directly use Webhook Response, we can use Code node to output results:

1. **Click connection point on right side of Set node**
2. **Search "Code"**
3. **Select "Code" node**
4. **Configure node**:
   - **Mode**: Run Once for All Items
   - **JavaScript Code**:
   ```javascript
   // Get all data
   const items = $input.all();
   
   // Output to console (view in N8N execution logs)
   console.log('Workflow executed successfully!');
   console.log('Data:', JSON.stringify(items, null, 2));
   
   // Return data
   return items;
   ```

5. **Save configuration**

[Screenshot location: Code node configuration]

### Step 5: Save and Execute Workflow

4. **Analyze execution process**:
   - View execution time of each node
   - View data changes at each node
   - If failed, view error information

[Screenshot location: Execution history interface]

### Step 6: Understand Data Flow

Understanding how data flows between nodes is very important.

#### 6.1 Data Format

N8N uses JSON format to pass data:

```json
{
  "json": {
    "field1": "value1",
    "field2": "value2"
  },
  "binary": {},
  "error": null
}
```

#### 6.2 Access Data

In nodes, can use expressions to access data:

- `{{ $json }}`: Get entire JSON object
- `{{ $json.fieldName }}`: Get specific field
- `{{ $json.array[0] }}`: Get array element
- `{{ $now }}`: Get current time
- `{{ $workflow.name }}`: Get workflow name

#### 6.3 Data Flow Tracking

1. **Execute workflow**
2. **Click each node**: View input and output data
3. **Compare data changes**: Observe data changes at each node
4. **Draw data flow diagram**: Record data state as it flows through each node
